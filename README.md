# Todo List Project
##NO DATABASE

This repository contains different versions and variations of the "Todo Daily" application.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the evolution and different implementations of a simple to-do list application. It includes:

1.  **`todo-daily-V1/`**: The original version of the dynamic Todo Daily web application.
2.  **`todo-daily-V2/`**: An enhanced and AI-polished version of the Todo Daily web application.
3.  **`tododailyStatic/`**: A static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript version of the Todo Daily application.

## Directory Structure

- **`todo-daily-V1/`**: Contains the first version of the Node.js, Express, and EJS based application. See `todo-daily-V1/README.md` for more details.
- **`todo-daily-V2/`**: Contains an updated version of the Node.js application, potentially with AI-assisted improvements, client-side JavaScript, and data persistence. See `todo-daily-V2/README.md` for more details.
- **`tododailyStatic/`**: Contains a purely static version of the application, suitable for direct browser rendering without a backend server. See `tododailyStatic/README.md` for more details.

## Purpose

This collection of projects can be used to:
- Compare different versions of the same application.
- Understand the progression from a basic version to a more refined one.
- See an example of a dynamic application versus a static one.
- Explore how AI can be used to polish and improve a codebase.

## Getting Started

To explore a specific version, navigate to its respective directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

- For `todo-daily-V1` and `todo-daily-V2`, you will typically need Node.js and npm installed to run the applications.
- For `tododailyStatic`, you can usually open the `index.html` file directly in a web browser.
